It houses the college office and residential quarters for students. It is a large double storeyed mansion marked by six low towers. Planned by Saadat Ali Khan, it was completed by his son Ghazi-ud-din Haider. It is built in the form of a castle fortified by a twelve foot wide moat over which there was formerly a drawbridge. During the first War of Independence, 1857, Khursheed Manzil served as the Mess House of the officers of the 32nd Regiment.</p>
